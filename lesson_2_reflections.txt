What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create .git file with metadata in it. It is not counted as commit, because we dont know which files we want to commit yet.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It involves both working directory and repository. It is stage between those two :). Its value is because of status command that show us commits that we had made and also files in working dir. and repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can see by status command that you added only one file and then commit changes made only on that one file.
